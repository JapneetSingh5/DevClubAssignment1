Today, the world is driven by software.Our lives revolve around software. 
devClub is where ideas are brought to life. devClub is where we take the first step into the world of software development and realise the impact we can have, or more precisely, the impact lines of otherwise meaningless characters sewn together in a specific fashion can have.
At devClub, magic is typed, compiled and then made accesible to every on campus at IIT Delhi, and beyond.
